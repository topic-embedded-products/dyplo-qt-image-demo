Dyplo Qt Image Processing Example Application

This application demonstrates how to use Dyplo:
- Allocating and programming "partial reconfigurable" nodes
- How to use the Dyplo DMA interfaces
- Process image data
- Integrate with a GUI and process in background (without threads)


Build

If you're using OpenEmbedded or Yocto to compile, this recipe provides a good
example:
  https://github.com/topic-embedded-products/meta-topic-desktop/blob/master/meta-topic-desktop/recipes-topic-desktop/demo/dyplo-qt-image-demo.bb

The program requires "libdyplo" to be present. Dowload, compile and install
libdyplo from here:
  https://github.com/topic-embedded-products/libdyplo
Run "sudo make install" to make it available for your system.

This program requires Qt5. For Ubuntu that means you'll have to type this:
  sudo apt install qt5-default qtbase5-dev qtcreator
Then run qtcreator and open the .pro file
